 ***Good Developer Mindset***

 Developers might become **victims** of complicated coding in large projects. That is often due to small and unnoticeable mistake in coding fundamentals. To avoid these issues, a developer must comprehend the basic mindset skills of coding. <br>

**The skills include the following:**
1.	The sole purpose of creating or developing a software is to help people as much as possible.
2.	The software or system design should be easy to create, read and maintain.
3.	Fully understanding the developing tools and requirements of the project is essential.
4.	A code should be as simple as possible.
5.	Avoid code complexity when possible, but control it when itâ€™s needed.
6.	Always make room for some future maintenance of changes in the code.
7.	Make priority for changes with a maximum value and that require minimum effort.
